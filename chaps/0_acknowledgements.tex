\section*{Acknowledgements}
To Prof. Kos: for showing me the best side of academia. Thank you for the many interesting meetings and your constant support and encouragement, especially throughout the development of this thesis.
\\ 



To Sara: for you have been the fixed point to which I have always gravitated back to (even though you have been moving quite a lot!!) and for the courage of going against me when you knew it was for my best. I cannot wait to start this new chapter of our lives, together. 
\\



To my sister: for it has not been easy to stay apart, but I hope it was for the best. Thank you for the support and the love you have always shown me, especially in the last year. I truly wish you to experience your upcoming university journey with such intensity and passion as I have.
\\



To the Innocent Group: for it has been quite a bumpy ride, but with you making it was way easier. Calling you friends is the best thing it happened to me in the Master's. 
\\



To me: for the long nights. For the courage and perseverance in testing my limits. For always sticking to my values in the upcoming life chapters.
