\section{Valuation}

    In this chapter, we compute the cost of the two option and study their sensitivities. We first introduce the methods we use to compute them --- namely Black-Scholes and lattice-based models --- and then show the main snippets of our code. We compute the cost to the employer under the risk-neutral framework and the executive value under a utility maximization framework. Finally, we compute some comparative statics, which allow us to explore better the relationship between subjective and objective incentives induced by the two options, as well as to compare the objective and subjective valuations, and to analyze how they change with different parameters.


\subsection{Valuation models} 

\subsubsection{Black-Scholes}
    The Black-Scholes model, developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in the early 1970s \citep{black1973pricing}, is a well-known mathematical framework used in finance to determine the theoretical value of European-style options. We will just limit ourselves to the minimum requirements and intuition to be able to use the Black-Scholes model in computing the time-value of our ESOs later. A more detailed overview of the model is out of our scope and can be easily found online. 
    
    The assumptions are quite standard, so we simply take them from \citet{wiki:blackscholes}:

    \begin{assumption}
        \label{ass:bs_1}
        The rate of return on the riskless asset is constant and denoted as risk-free interest rate $r$.
    \end{assumption}
    

    \begin{assumption}
        \label{ass: bs_2}
        The instantaneous log return of the stock price is an infinitesimal random walk with drift: the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion, and it is assumed that the drift and volatility of the motion are constant.
    \end{assumption}

    \begin{assumption}
        \label{ass:bs_3}
        The stock does not pay any dividends.
    \end{assumption}

    \begin{assumption}
        \label{ass:bs_4}
        The market is arbitrage-free.
    \end{assumption}

    \begin{assumption}
        \label{ass:bs_5}
        It is possible to borrow and lend any amount (even fractional) of cash at the riskless rate.
    \end{assumption}

    \begin{assumption}
        \label{ass:bs_6}
        It is possible to buy and sell any amount (even fractional) of the stock.
    \end{assumption}
    
    \begin{assumption}
        \label{ass:bs_7}
        There are no transaction fees.
    \end{assumption}
    
    Note that the first three assumptions are about the underlying asset while the last four are about the market. Moreover, assumption \ref*{ass:bs_6} assumes the possibility of short-selling and free trade of the stock, which in the case of ESOs is usually not fully possible. Nevertheless, the Black-Scholes model provides a good approximation and suffices for our (limited) use. Note however that not all of these assumptions are strictly necessary: extensions of this basic model are able to account for dynamic interest rates, transaction costs and taxes, and dividend payout.  

    Under these assumptions, \citet{black1973pricing} showed that it is possible to create a hedged position (i.e., a long position in the underlying stock and a long position in the option) whose value is independent of the price of the underlying. This dynamic hedging strategy leads to a partial differential equation governing the price of the option, whose solution is given by the Black-Scholes formula.

    However, despite its mathematical rigor and closed-form solution, as well as computational efficiency, Black-Scholes can only be used with European options (options exercisable only at maturity). Therefore, since we are dealing with (American) ESOs, we need to resort to a different valuation methodology for most of our analysis: lattice-based models.

\subsubsection{Lattice tree methods} 
\textbf{Binomial model}\\
The binomial model was first proposed by William Sharpe in the 1978 \citep{sharpe1978investments} and later formalized by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (CRR) in 1979. It uses a lattice-based approach to model the price of the underlying stock price. We employ it to value our employee stock options.\footnote{As said before, Black-Scholes can only be used to value European options. Notwithstanding this, Black-Scholes valuation provides a lower-bound to the value of American options: indeed, giving the holder the possibility to exercise before maturity also cannot be worse for her, because she can always simply hold the option up to maturity and then exercise if in-the-money, mimicking thus the behavior under a European option.}
Similarly to Monte Carlo simulations and finite difference methods, the binomial options pricing model does not yield a closed-form solution, but works quite well with a sufficiently high number $n$ of time steps, i.e., with a sufficiently discretized grid (that is, a small $\Delta t$). Clearly, for European options, as $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$, the binomial model approaches the Black-Scholes value, which can be thus seen as its limiting case.

We need assumptions \ref*{ass:bs_1}, \ref*{ass:bs_3}, \ref*{ass:bs_4}, \ref*{ass:bs_7} from Black-Scholes, and in addition we pose two additional assumptions:

\begin{assumption}
    \label{ass:bin_8}
    Time is divided into discrete periods.
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}
    \label{ass:bin_9}
    At any time step, the underlying's price can only move one of two ways: either up or down.
\end{assumption}

\input{fig/bin_tree} 

The intuition behind the model is quite simple. We discretize the evolution of the underlying stock price by building a binomial lattice (tree), for a given number of steps between the issue of the option and its maturity. Each node represents thus a possible price of the underlying stock. From each node, the stock price can either go up ($u$) or down ($d$), with probability $q$ or $1-q$. The key assumption is thus that the stock moves only in either one of these two directions. Therefore, the generic value of the stock at step $t$ with $k$ upward movements and $t-k$ downward movements is $S_t = S_0 u^k d^{t-k}$, where $S_0$ is the initial stock price at $t=0$. Figure \ref*{fig:bin_tree} provides a graphical representation of the first two levels of the stock price tree. 
 

We can divide the procedure in three main steps: (i) build the stock tree, (ii) calculate the option value at each terminal node, (iii) go backwards and decide at each node whether it is optimal to exercise or keep the option.

We use the original CRR method and set $u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}$ and $d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}=\frac{1}{u}$, which are the multiplicative factors if the stock price goes up or down, respectively. Note that the price multipliers $u$ and $d$ depend thus only on volatility of the underlying and time step $\Delta t$ and not on the drift.\footnote{This is the reason for which the probability of going up is usually higher in this model, to compensate for the missing account of the drift component.} Therefore, the value of the stock when it goes up or down depends also on its underlying volatility. Moreover, the condition $d = \frac{1}{u}$ ensures that the tree is recombinant, meaning that what matters is the total number of ups and downs, not their order. This means that if the stock price moves up and then down, the stock price will be the same as if it instead moved first down and then up. Indeed, as can be seen from figure \ref*{fig:bin_tree}, $S_0ud$ can be reached by either first going up and down, or first down and then up. This is convenient also because it allows the tree representation of the underlying stock price, ensuring that all the nodes are nicely connected, and it fastens the calculation of the option price (indeed, note that in this way the number of total nodes is reduced). 

In the second step, we simply compute the option value at expiration, i.e., its intrinsic value, which in the case of our call option is $\max \{0, S_T - K \}$.

For the third step, we need to introduce the risk-neutral probability $q = \frac{e^{-r \Delta t} - d}{u-d}$ which assesses how likely is that the stock price goes up during each period in a risk-neutral world.\footnote{This choice of $q$ allows for the related binomial distribution to simulate the geometric Brownian motion of the underlying stock, with parameters $r$ and $\sigma$.} In this world, today's fair price of the option is the expected value of its future payoff discounted by the risk-free rate. Therefore, the expected value at time $t$ is calculated using the option values from the subsequent two nodes at $t+1$, weighted by their respective probabilities --- $q$ as the probability of an upward move of the underlying stock, $1-q$ of a downward move. This value is then discounted using $r$ and represents the binomial value of the option at a given node. 
Given $q$, we can then proceed with our backwards algorithm. We start at each pre-terminal node and evaluate whether it is optimal to exercise (with payoff the stock price at the node minus the strike price) or to not exercise (with payoff the binomial value at the node). We continue this process iteratively going backwards until when the option is vested. When the option is not vested anymore, the holder cannot exercise it and so the value of the option will simply be the binomial value, at that node and all the previous ones.
The value of the option at the initial node, obtained with this backwards procedure, is the value of the ESO we obtain using the binomial model.
This is the traditional backwards approach; however, we will modify slightly the decision function in the last step to account for the tendency of early exercise, using the multiple technique of \citet{cox1979option}. \\


\textbf{Trinomial model}\\
The trinomial option pricing model was  first developed by \citet{boyle1986option} as an extension of the binomial model. Conceptually, the two models are the same: here we are only allowing for the stock to have a third path, the middle path, whereby it does not go down nor up but remains stable over the next time step. Therefore, the differences from the binomial model are very few. We replace assumption \ref*{ass:bin_9} with the following:
\begin{assumption}
    \label{ass:trin_10}
    At any time step, the underlying's price can only move one of three ways: either up, down, or remain stable.
\end{assumption}
As before, $u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}$, $d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}=\frac{1}{u}$, and now $m=1$. Moreover, we need to change the risk-neutral probabilities (before we had two, now three), which become slightly more complicated:\footnote{Recall that we do not consider dividend yields on our stock, hence the formulas are slightly easier than usually presented.}
$$ q_u = \Biggl(\frac{e^{r \Delta t / 2} - e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t / 2}}}{e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t / 2}} - e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t / 2}}}\Biggr)^2 $$
$$ q_d = \Biggl(\frac{e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t / 2}} - e^{r \Delta t / 2}}{e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t / 2}} - e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t / 2}}}\Biggr)^2 $$
$$ q_m = 1 - (p_u + p_d) $$

Therefore, the idea of the procedure is the same: we compute the stock price tree and then proceed backwards to determine the optimal decision at each node. The difference now is that the option at each non-terminal node is computed based on three later nodes --- instead of two --- and their relative probabilities.
The trinomial model produces more accurate results compared to the binomial model when using fewer time steps, but the binomial model is usually preferred due to its faster implementation.

\subsection{Firm cost} 
%Objective value

We compute the cost of the two options to the firm using the classical valuation standards for American ESOs: a simple binomial model for the RN option, and a modified binomial model that accounts for the recovered time premium for the R option.
Recall indeed that the theoretical value of an option at any time $t$ is given by (i) the intrinsic value ($S_t - K$) and (ii) the time premium, i.e., the remaining value forfeited at exercise, which basically accounts for the possibility that the option appreciates in the remaining lifetime.
We employ the binomial tree approach from \citet{cox1979option}; however, we account for deterministic early exercise introducing a threshold above which the holder will exercise, i.e., always exercise if $S_t \ge K*m$ for some multiple $m$ \citep{hull2004value}, which we set at $m = 2$.

We now comment the relevant code used --- the full code can be found in the Online Appendix.

\subsubsection{RN option}
The function \verb|rn_eso| is defined as \verb|rn_eso(S0,K,T,v,r,N,sigma,m)| and takes the following parameters as input:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S_0$: spot price of the underlying firm stock
    \item $K$: strike price of the option; we always set it equal to $S_0$ %\footnote{Some propose to set it slightly higher ...}
    \item $T$: time to maturity (in years)
    \item $v$: vesting period of the option (in years)
    \item $disc$: risk-free interest rate
    \item $N$: height of the tree
    \item $sigma$: volatility of the underlying firm stock
    \item $m$: exercise multiple.
\end{itemize}

    
We follow the binomial model procedure illustrated before: we first construct the stock price tree, and then we compute the option's value backwards. As mentioned above, we change slightly the decision function at each node, using the multiple technique proposed by \citet{hull2004value}. Therefore, we model early exercise as taking place whenever stock price reaches a certain multiple --- from here the name --- of the strike price.
At each step, the relevant decision is the following: if the option is either not vested or is vested but is not above the threshold for early exercise, the value at the node is the binomial value. Otherwise, if it is vested and above the threshold for early exercise, the value at the node is the exercise value. This procedure is illustrated in snippet \ref*{fig:val_rn}.

\vspace*{15pt}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{lstlisting}[breaklines, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
    if not vested: 
        C[j] = disc * (q*C_up + (1-q)*C_down)
    elif vested & (S>=K*m):            
        C[j] = S - K
    elif vested & (S<K*m):
        C[j] = disc * (q*C_up + (1-q)*C_down)
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Valuation of RN option}
 \label{fig:val_rn}
\end{figure}
\vspace*{15pt}

\newpage
\subsubsection{R option}
We define the function \verb|r_eso| as \verb|r_eso(S0,K,T,v,r,N,sigma,m,alpha,gamma)|.
    


We use the same parameters as above, with the addition of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $alpha$: amount of option that gets converted to cash at exercise
    \item $gamma$: risk premium granted in terms of new RN option at exercise. 
\end{itemize}

The valuation here is trickier because the payoff at exercise is not any more given only by the difference between the stock price and the strike price, but also by the time value that gets recouped with the issuance of the new option. It is hence clear that, holding the same parameters, the cost of \verb|rn_eso| is a lower bound for \verb|r_eso|. We follow the procedure proposed by \citet{huang2013dynamic} in snippet \ref*{fig:val_r_gamma0}. The difference from above is that, in the case of the option being vested and above the threshold for (early) exercise, the payoff is given by its intrinsic value plus a portion of its time value, computed as the Black-Scholes cost minus the intrinsic value, multiplied by the percentage that gets recouped. 

\vspace*{15pt}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{lstlisting}[breaklines, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
    if not vested:                
        C[j] = disc * (q*C_up + (1-q)*C_down)
    elif vested & (S >= K*m): 
        C[j] = (S - K) + 
                (1-alpha)*(black_scholes(S,K,T,r,sigma)-(S-K))
    elif vested & (S < K*m):
        C[j] = disc * (q*C_up + (1-q)*C_down)
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Valuation of R option with $\gamma=0$}
    \label{fig:val_r_gamma0}
\end{figure}
\vspace*{15pt}

 We run a simulation using the parameters from \citet{huang2013dynamic} ($S_0$=30, K=30, T=10, v=3, r=0.05, N=1, sigma=0.3, m=2) and obtain the following results: \$13.66 for RN, \$14.55 for R. Therefore, the cost of the RN option is the same as the one they find, while the cost of the R option is higher than the one they find (\$14.14). It is unclear where this difference comes from; it could simply be a difference in the choice of the number of time steps per year, which they do not however present explicitly. Nevertheless, running the binomial model with N=1 is too low, as table \ref*{tab:diff_n} shows. Indeed, this means allowing the stock to have only one movement per year, which is quite restrictive. The results from table \ref*{tab:diff_n} suggest thus that it is safer to run these simulations with at least N=500.
 %We will do it with N=1000

 \input{fig/tab_diff_n.tex}

However, this valuation is incomplete, because we are not considering the role played by $\gamma$. In their paper, \citet{huang2013dynamic} show only one example, where 75\% of the option gets exercised and another 25\% (i.e., 100\% - 75\%) gets reloaded. Therefore, it is unclear how they would consider a strictly positive risk premium $\gamma > 0$. 


\vspace*{15pt}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}[breaklines, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small] 
    if not vested:                         
        C[j] = disc * (q*C_up + (1-q)*C_down)
    elif vested & (S >= K*m):                
        C[j] =  (1+gamma)*(S - K) + 
                (1-alpha+gamma)*(black_scholes(S,K,T,r,sigma)-(S-K))
    elif vested & (S < K*m):  
        C[j] = disc * (q*C_up + (1-q)*C_down)
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Valuation of a generic $R_{\alpha, \gamma}$ option}
    \label{fig:val_r}
\end{figure}
\vspace*{15pt}

Therefore, we elaborate a novel approach which builds up on their original idea. Note that the value of adding $\gamma$ is two-fold: first, as a proper exercise compensation since the executive gets stock and options worth $(1+\gamma)$ the number of options she previously held, and second as time value recovered. Therefore, we propose the valuation methodology in snippet \ref*{fig:val_r} for our R option which embeds this double edge provided by $\gamma$: \verb|1+gamma*(S - K)| captures the first effect, \verb|(1-alpha+gamma)*(black_scholes(S,K,T,r,sigma)-(S-K))| the second.
Clearly, this methodology equals the previous when $\gamma = 0$. Therefore, it can be seen as a proper extension of Snippet \ref*{fig:val_r_gamma0}.


\subsection{Executive value}
We now turn to the subjective value of the option to the risk-averse executive, that we compute using the trinomial model under a utility maximization framework. In our setting, the executive is interested in maximizing its expected utility at time $t=0$; therefore, she will take a forward-looking perspective at the possible stock price grid and, by backwards induction starting from the terminal nodes, she will compute the utility she can expect given the initial parameters. This will then be translated in the amount of cash compensation she would require to give up her options, which results therefore in a certainty equivalence in continuous time. 

We build on the model proposed by \citet{lau2005valuation} that computes the value of an option with multiple reloads and fixed expiry date using a trinomial tree under the framework of maximizing the expected utility value of the terminal wealth, where the risk aversion factor is embedded in the coefficient and choice of the utility function. However, differently from them, our R option can be reloaded only once, which allows us to simplify the algorithm. For the RN option, the procedure will be even simpler. The key in both cases is that, at each non-terminal node, the executive is maximizing her utility by deciding whether to exercise or continue (hold), and this will be done as before by dynamic programming starting from the terminal nodes.
To be more precise, \citet{lau2005valuation} construct the numerical approximation extending the trinomial model via the forward shooting approach, which consists in augmenting the information at each node with a vector of auxiliary variables and modeling the function that describes how the vector evolves from one node to the following. We do not need such formal specification as our model is simpler than theirs; we will instead compute the non-firm related wealth available at each node using the appropriate formula rather than computing it when building the stock price tree. This approach is sensible as it is simpler yet computationally the same.

We use the same parameters from above for the two options. In addition, we need to add the following: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $rho: $ coefficient of relative risk aversion of the executive
    \item $c: $ non-firm related initial wealth, that grows continuously at the risk-free rate $r$
    \item $n_s: $ number of stocks initially held by the executive
    \item $n_o: $ number of options initially held by the executive.
\end{itemize}
Note that, at each time step $t$, the value of the non-firm related wealth $c_t$ is computed as $c_t = c \bigl(1+\frac{r}{N}\bigr)^{t}$, where $N$ is the number of time steps in a given year and $r$ the annual risk-free rate. 


Therefore, we want to find $E_c$ such that 
$$U_\rho(n_s, n_o, c) = U_\rho(n_S, 0, c + E_c) $$ %%NOT CONSISTENT WITH UTILITY DEFINED BEFORE
where we included only the most relevant parameters entering the executive's utility function. Clearly, we then divide $E_c$ by the number of options $n_o$ to get the executive value of one ESO. Therefore, the external wealth of the executive becomes relevant now, both in terms of absolute wealth and portfolio composition (i.e., percentage of total wealth held in firm stocks). This is because the utility function is not separable, hence our results will be sensible to the initial values we will choose. In other words, $E_c$ is the adjustment to the executive's wealth required to keep her on the same utility level while not granting her any option.

Recall that we defined the executive's utility of wealth with the power utility function, that is, 
$$\bar{u}_\rho(w) = \frac{w^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}$$
with $\rho = 1 - \gamma $ being the (constant) coefficient of relative risk aversion. 
The inverse utility is thus given by:
$$w(\bar{u}_\rho) = \Bigl( (1-\rho)\bar{u}_\rho \Bigr)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}$$
We use these two formulas to define the functions \verb|u(w, rho)| and \\
\verb|u_minus(u, rho)| that return $\bar{u}$ and $w$, respectively. We will use them to compute the exercise value at each node and to derive then the certainty equivalent at the initial node. Clearly, the executive value is not unique --- as it was the case with the firm cost --- but changes as the coefficient of risk aversion (and initial wealth) changes.

Note that we follow the approach used in the literature and assume that only block exercise is possible to keep our algorithm simple. A detailed analysis of separate exercises would be quite complex and computationally intensive. 
Finally, a possible modification of the algorithm would be to embed also here an exercise multiple mechanism, that we could make dependent on the risk aversion coefficient of the executive.\footnote{For example, we could set $\frac{m}{1+\rho}$ as the threshold for early exercise for some fixed $m$, so that it would be lower for more risk averse holders. In other words, more risk averse executives would exercise earlier, which is consistent with the empirical findings.} However, we do not explore this venue here.
We will now outline briefly the main components of our algorithm, as done before.

\subsubsection{RN option}
We define the function \verb|CE_rn_trinomial(S0,K,T,v,r,N,sigma,rho, n_s,n_o,c)| to compute the executive value of the RN option. At each node, the exercise utility is computed considering the total wealth at the node, which is the sum of the non-firm related wealth $c$ invested at the risk-free rate $r$, the stock value, and the option value. Snippet \ref*{fig:ce_exec_rn} shows the relevant part of the code.
\newpage 

\vspace*{15pt}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{lstlisting}[breaklines, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
        cont_value = q_u * U[j+1,i+1] + q_d*U[j,i+1] + q_m*U[j,i]
        excs_value = util(c*((1+r/N)**n)+ n_s*S[j,n] + 
                     n_o*max(0, S[j,n]-K), rho)
        
        if vested:
            U[j,i] = max(cont_value, excs_value)
        else: 
            U[j,i] = cont_value
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Valuation of RN option in a utility maximization framework}
    \label{fig:ce_exec_rn}
\end{figure}
\vspace*{15pt}

Note that the continuation value is the average of three different values, which reflect the possible paths the stock can follow, weighted by the respective risk-neutral probabilities. The exercise value is instead the utility of the wealth at the node, which is the sum of the non-firm related wealth, the stock value, and the option value. 

After this backwards iteration, we finally compute the executive value $E_c$ as \\
\verb|RN_ce = (u_minus(U[0,0], rho)-c-n_s*S0)/n_o|.
In other words, we find the level of wealth at time $t=0$ required to reach the same utility as the executive would have with the RN options. From this, we subtract the initial wealth and the value of the stocks, and then divide by the number of options to find the certainty equivalent value per RN option.

\subsubsection{R option}
We follow a similar approach to the above and define the function\\
\verb|CE_r_trinomial(S0,K,T,v,r,N,sigma,rho, alpha,gamma, n_s,n_o,c)| to compute the executive value of the R option. The main difference is that we now need to compute the exercise value at each node considering also the time value that gets recouped at exercise. The procedure follows a similar approach to that of the R option as firm cost. The relevant part of the code is shown in snippet \ref*{fig:ce_exec_r}.

\vspace*{15pt}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{lstlisting}[breaklines, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
        cont_value = q_u * U[j+1,i+1] + q_d*U[j,i+1] + q_m*U[j,i]
        excs_value = util(  c*((1+r/N)**n) +              
                            n_s*S[j,n] + 
                            max(0, 
                                n_o*(alpha*(S[j,n]-K)) + 
                                CE_rn_trinomial(S[j,n],S[j,n],T,v,r,N,sigma,rho,n_s,n_o*(1-alpha+gamma),c*((1+r/N)**n))), rho)

        if vested:
            U[j,i] = max(cont_value, excs_value)
        else: 
            U[j,i] = cont_value
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Valuation of a generic $R_{\alpha, \gamma}$ option in a utility maximization framework}
    \label{fig:ce_exec_r}
\end{figure}
\vspace*{15pt}


Note that now the exercise value is more complicated than before. Indeed, the option value is now given by the immediate exercise payoff $S-K$, where $S$ is the stock price at a given node, multiplied by $\alpha$, plus the cash equivalent of the new $(1-\alpha+\gamma)$ options that the executive receives. Therefore, she may \textit{a priori} decide also to exercise the option even if the stock price is below the strike price, as the time value that gets recouped may be higher than the intrinsic value. This could happen for example when $\alpha$ is quite low and $\gamma$ is sufficiently high. 
After the backwards iteration, we compute the executive value $E_c$ as described before for the RN option.

\subsection{Comparative statics}
We now perform a series of numerical simulations to analyze how the objective (firm's) and subjective (agent's) valuations differ as we change some key parameters, and what this implies in terms of incentives. We start with the following parameters and change accordingly when needed: $S_0$ = 30, $K$ = 30, $T$ = 10, $v$ = 2, $r$ = 0.045, $N$ = 100, $sigma$ = 0.3, $m$ = 2, $rho$ = 2, $alpha$ = 0.75, $gamma$ = 0.25, $c$ = 1,700,000, $n_s$ = 110,000, and $n_o$ = 300 for a 67-33 portfolio, otherwise we set $c$ = 2,500,000 and $n_s$ = 87,333 for a 50-50 portfolio.

\subsubsection{Valuation Ratios}
We first study the relationship between firm's and executive's valuation by examining 3 main ratios: firm cost, executive value, and deadweight ratio, which we define as follows:

\vspace{-2em}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Executive value ratio } (\alpha) &= \frac{\text{Executive value of } R_{\alpha,0}}{\text{Executive value of RN}} \\[1em]
    \text{Firm cost ratio } (\alpha) & = \frac{\text{Firm cost of } R_{\alpha,0}}{\text{Firm cost of RN}} \\[1em]
    \text{Deadweight cost } (\alpha, \gamma) &= \frac{\text{Firm cost of } R_{\alpha,\gamma} - \text{Executive value of } R_{\alpha,\gamma}}{\text{Firm cost of }R_{\alpha,\gamma}}
\end{align*}
\vspace{-2em}

The first two ratios are useful to understand how the firm cost and executive value change with the introduction of the reload feature only, i.e., without any premium $\gamma$, while the third one allows to explore the difference between firm cost and executive value, now in the case of the fully fledged $R_{\alpha,\gamma}$ option. %WHEN was it mentioned before?

Table \ref*{tab:val_ratios} presents the results for the first two ratios with different values of $\alpha$. For the benchmark case of the 67-33 executive, we see that $\alpha = 1$, i.e., the RN option, provides the highest executive value, at all risk aversion levels. The same is true for the 50-50 executives with $\rho = 2, 2.5$, whereas the least risk-averse prefers slightly $R_{0.75,0}$. But these differences are all quite small. The executive value is decreasing in the coefficient of risk aversion at all levels of $\alpha$, while the firm cost is increasing in $\alpha$, as expected. By comparing the ratios, it seems that the R option is more burdensome for the firm rather than for the agent.  
\input{fig/values_ratios.tex}

Finally, Table \ref*{tab:deadweight_ratio} shows the deadweight ratio for different values of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. We see that it is increasing in the executive type for all combinations of $(\alpha, \gamma)$, as the firm cost is fixed whereas the executive value decreases. But the interesting part is that the deadweight ratio is increasing in $\gamma$ at all $\alpha$ levels, for both the 67-33 and 50-50 executives, with rare (and small) exceptions. This is due to the fact that most times the executive value goes down with the introduction of the risk premium, but even when this does not happen the firm cost is increasing faster, hence the deadweight ratio goes up. This may appear as counterintuitive because one could have expected that a positive $\gamma$ locks in part of the gains deriving from stock price appreciation, enough so to compensate for the higher firm cost. 
Therefore, it seems that also from a deadweight standpoint, it remains optimal for the firm to offer the RN option, rather than any of the considered R contracts.

\subsubsection{Objective and subjective incentives}
We now examine the effect on incentives implied by this difference in firm cost and executive value. Specifically, we analyze the incentives to exert effort and increase volatility, i.e., respectively the delta and vega of the two options. We refer to objective incentive when referring to the firm, as it is uniquely determined by firm's cost, and to subjective incentive when referring to the executive, since the value changes with her risk aversion. For computational reasons, we limit ourselves to the case of 3 levels of risk aversion, namely $\rho \in \{1.5, 2, 2.5\}$ We now explore the following ratios: 

\vspace{-2em}

\begin{align*}
\text{Objective delta} &= \frac{\text{\% increase in firm cost}}{\text{\% increase in stock price}} \\[1em]
\text{Subjective delta} &= \frac{\text{\% increase in executive value}}{\text{\% increase in stock price}} \\[1em]
\text{Objective vega} &= \frac{\text{\% increase in firm cost}}{\text{\% increase in stock volatility}} \\[1em]
\text{Subjective vega} &= \frac{\text{\% increase in executive value}}{\text{\% increase in stock vol}}
\end{align*}

\vspace{1em}


We first consider the RN option with the parameters from above. Figure \ref*{fig:rn_delta_obj} shows that the objective incentive is increasing in the stock price, as expected. We notice two things: first, it grows concavely up to $\$40$ ca., and then convexly; second, the incentive at $\$30$ is higher than $0.6$, whereas for an ATM call option we would expect it to be at $0.5$. On the other hand, subjective incentive displayed in Figure \ref*{fig:rn_delta_subj} shows a different pattern: it is very low when the option is OTM, jumps significantly when the option is close to being ATM, and then decreases slowly the deeper it goes ITM. This behavior can be interpreted as follows: the executive has a higher incentive to increase effort when the stock price gets closer to the strike price, as she feels she has more to gain, while she decreases the effort as the option gets more OTM because she feels she has less to gain now. Finally, we note that the incentive is higher for less risk-averse agents at all stock prices, which confirms that the incentive arguments works better for less risk averse employees \citep{lau2005valuation}. Finally, in Figure \ref*{fig:rn_delta_comp} we compare the two incentives: we see that the objective incentive is higher than the subjective one when the option is OTM --- except for the subjective's spike just before the strike price --- while the subjective incentive is higher when the option is ITM. This suggests that the firm may overestimate the incentive effect of the option when it is OTM, and underestimate it when it is ITM; in other words, the firm may be better off by granting the option slightly OTM rather than ATM.

We now focus on the vega of the RN option. From the firm's perspective (Figure \ref*{fig:rn_vega_obj}), the executive has always a strong incentive to increase the volatility because higher volatility increases the cost of the option as it increases the probability of it finishing ITM. But from the executive's perspective (Figure \ref*{fig:rn_vega_subj}), the incentive is always negative, which means that she would prefer to decrease rather than to increase volatility, the less so the less risk-averse she is. This is consistent with the idea that the executive is risk-averse and hence prefers a more stable stock price, and could imply that the firm's volatility is already too high for the executive, hence she does not want to increase if further. Therefore, we would expect the (risk-averse) executives to prefer projects with lower rather than higher volatility.

\vspace*{15pt}

We now move to the R option. For computational reasons, we will only consider an example with $\alpha = 0.75$ and $\gamma = 0.1$, shorter x-axis, and only one executive with $\rho = 2$. Figures \ref*{fig:r_delta_obj} and \ref*{fig:r_delta_subj} show a similar picture to the previous case of the RN option: the objective incentive is increasing steeply in the stock price, while the subjective is low in the OTM region, but then spikes just before the strike price. However, there are also two relevant differences: first, the objective incentive is close to 0 at $\$20$, while before it was well above $0.5$; second, both the overall level and the spike of the subjective incentive are lower than before, which seem to indicate that the executive perceives a lower incentive to exert effort with this R option rather than with the RN. Moreover, in Figure \ref*{fig:r_delta_comp} we see that the objective incentive is now always higher than the subjective one.

\end{figure}
\vspace*{15pt}

To conclude, Figure \ref*{fig:r_vega_obj} and Figure \ref*{fig:r_vega_subj} show the volatility incentive of the R option. Compared to before, the objective incentive is still increasing, and it is higher, while the subjective incentive is still decreasing and negative, even lower than before. From the firm's (risk-neutral) perspective, volatility increases indeed the value of the current option, and especially of the reloaded option, both because higher volatility may imply even higher price for the reloaded part\footnote{Recall that, in general, the value of a call option is higher as time to maturity increases} and because we now have ``more option'' due to the positive premium $\gamma$. On the other hand, the R option increases even more the timeframe of exposure to the stock volatility, which is not desirable for the risk-averse executive.
